#SecureCodingChecklist
This checklist provides a systematic approach to secure coding practices. Developers should adhere to these points throughout the development lifecycle to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Input Validation
[]Validate all user inputs on the server-side using allow-lists (e.g., with libraries like validator or joi).
[]Validate input type, length, format, and range before processing.
[]Sanitize input by stripping unwanted characters or HTML tags where applicable.

## Output Encoding
[]Encode data contextually (HTML, JavaScript, URL) before outputting to the browser.
[]Avoid using innerHTML; prefer textContent or document.createElement for dynamic content.
[]If HTML output is necessary, sanitize with DOMPurify before insertion.

##Secure DOM Manipulation
[]Avoid eval(), Function constructor, setTimeout with strings, and innerHTML.
[]Use safe DOM APIs like textContent or setAttribute for user-controlled data.
[]Sanitize user-controlled data with DOMPurify before DOM insertion.

##Content Security Policy (CSP)
[]Implement a strict CSP header via HTTP responses.
[]Avoid 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' in CSP directives.
[]Use nonces or hashes for inline scripts and styles.

##Subresource Integrity (SRI)
[]Use SRI for all third-party scripts by adding integrity attributes.
[]Generate hashes (e.g., SHA-384) for external scripts and update them when scripts change.

##Dependency Management
[]Source dependencies from trusted repositories (e.g., npm, official CDNs).
[]Regularly update dependencies using npm audit or snyk.
[]Audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities during build processes.

##Security Headers
[]Set HTTP security headers: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: DENY, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
[]Use Helmet.js for Express.js applications to automate header setting.

##Session Management
[]Use secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite flags for cookies.
[]Implement session expiration and rotation.

##Error Handling
[]Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages; use generic messages for users.
[]Log errors securely for debugging without revealing internal details.

##Additional Best Practices
[]Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
[]Implement rate limiting and authentication mechanisms.
[]Conduct regular security training and code reviews.
